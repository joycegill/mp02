# Revisions
My code had issues running so I did not receive any checkmarks for the first attempt of my mini project. 
I made changes to the way QuickCalculator and Interactive Calculator take in the parameters to fix this issue.
I also fixed my BigFraction to make sure that it returns the fractions in the simplest format. 
Lastly, I made several revisions to BFCalculator in general to accomodate the new way QuickCalculator and Interactive Calculator take in the parameters.
